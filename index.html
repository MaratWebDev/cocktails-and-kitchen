				<p>Filmed on location at the House of Peroni in London, this is Simone's beer cocktail with a twist. It's a cocktail but it looks like a pint of lager! This is a recipe you can make in bulk and will serve 10 people, so it's the perfect drink to serve at your next dinner party and surprise your guests. It's fruity, beery, crisp, fresh and delicious! Give it a go and let us know what you think.</p>

					<p>THE RECIPE 
					Put 1tsp of honey and a measure of whisky in a mug or heatproof glass. Add two cloves and half a cinnamon stick then top up with just-off-the-boil water. Stir in a slice of lemon and just enough lemon juice to balance the sweetness of the honey. Drink as soon as it doesn't burn your lips.

					THE TRICK
					Go easy on the cloves. Use water that is just off the boil. Putting a spoon in the glass will prevent it cracking as you pour the water in. Use a lightly flavoured honey so it doesn't make your toddy taste like cough mixture. Drink while it is still quite hot - it will be more soothing that way. Do not take at the same time as any other medicine.

					THE TWIST
					Some people suggest rum as an alternative. A couple of crushed juniper berries will add an aromatic citrus hit. Try a slice of apple in the drink. It will soak up the flavours, soften in the heat, and can be eaten when you get to the end - a bit like mulled cider. Allspice berries can be included with the cloves. Brown sugar is the answer for those who don't like honey. I have heard of some who add a slice of butter to their toddy. Not sure I could swallow that, but friends swear by it to calm a sore throat.</p>

				<div class="feed"><h2>Icy-Cool Green Tea Mojitos</h2>
					<p>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
					4 large mint leaves (I substituted 1 shiso leaf, torn into several large pieces)
					2 teaspoons sugar
					approx. 1/2 cup brewed green tea, chilled
					1 ounce white rum

					Muddle the lime juice, mint (or shiso), and sugar together in a Collins glass until the leaves bruise lightly and the flavors release. Add ice until glass is about 3/4 full and then pour in rum and green tea. Stir thoroughly.

					To serve as a pitcher drink: Multiple the ingredients by the number of guests. Muddle the lime juice, mint, and sugar. Combine with the green tea and white rum in a pitcher and stir to combine. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>

					<p>For the Fennel Syrup (makes about 1 cup)
					1 1/2 tbsp. fennel seeds
					1 cup granulated sugar
					1 cup water
					For the Spritzer
					2 oz. (1/4 cup) unfiltered apple juice
					1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice
					10 oz. (1 1/4 cup) seltzer or sparkling water
					Apple slices and fennel fronds, for garnish (optional)
					Instructions
					Make the fennel syrup: Coarsely grind fennel seeds in a spice grinder. Add seeds, sugar and water to a small saucepan set over medium heat. Bring mixture to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and let stand for 20 minutes. Pour the fennel syrup through a fine strainer and let cool until room temperature, about 30 minutes. Syrup will keep, airtight, in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

				<div class="feed"><h2>Birthday Cake Shot</h2>
					<p>It was my girlfriend's birthday party last Thursday and to make it extra special, I made these birthday cake shots.  I used Three Olives cake vodka, you can also use Pinnacle vodka.  I skipped the addition of the cake mix which is used in most recipes.  These shots were so pretty nobody wanted to take them (that's a first).  They were also really delicious and tasted like birthday cake.  Make them for your next celebration.
					RECIPE: 1 part(s) Three Olives or Pinnacle cake vodka 1 part(s) Godiva chocolate liqueur 1 part(s) half & half Rim martini glass with multi-colored sprinkles Shake with ice, strain into a chilled shot glass </p>
